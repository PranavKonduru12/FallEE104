OPS Analysis
---------------
	- IRV circuit components can be modified in lines 3 to 9 

TRAN Analysis
--------------------
	- RCL circuit components can be modified in lines 13 to 19 consist

PZ Analysis
------------
	- RCL circuit values can be modified in lines 13 to 18
		- Extra components/nodes cannot be added to the program without making large-scale changes
		- Symbolic and AC analysis is under PZ Analysis
